## Course outline
CSCI 4430 takes a top-down approach to explore how networks operate and how network applications work. We study how popular distributed systems such as video streaming, content distribution networks (CDNs), and cloud computing systems work in the application layer. We explore how these applications transfer data between their components and end users over the Internet using transport layer protocols such as TCP and UDP. We go deeper to understand what keeps the transport layer running; specifically, we look at how packets are routed and how routers work. Finally, we dive one more layer down to understand how the link layer transfer packets using Ethernet. In addition to cutting through the layers and covering the basics, we learn about the state-of-the-art topics in networking such as datacenter networks, software-defined networking (SDN), and (time permits) programmable networks.

From a practical point of view, we learn what sockets are and how to use them. And we write code. We write code to implement various protocols, to build client-server applications, video streaming applications, and transport protocols.

### Textbook (optional)
The course materials are based upon the following classic textbook of Kurose and Ross. In addition, many materials are also borrowed heavily from [Mosharaf Chowdhury](http://www.mosharaf.com/)'s [computer networks](https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489) course with his permission. Credit is given whenever possible to Mosharaf and a lot of other folks, especially for the ESTR lecture notes.
- Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th. (or earlier editions), by Jim Kurose and Keith Ross, 2016. ISBN 978-0133594140.

### Grading
| Assessment item | CSCI Weight | 
| :---------------- | :--- | 
| Assignments | 55% | 
| Tutorial Quizzes* | 5% |
| Final Exam | 40% | 
| Project | 0% |

\*: To encourage tutorial participation, quiz will be conducted at the tutorials randomly. We will randomly pick 5 tutorials and perform a quiz at the end of the tutorial. Each quiz is worth one mark.

## Course policies
- Homework and project: 
  * No late submission.
  * Grace tokens: You have **2** grace tokens, each can be used to give you a 24-hr extension on one assignment. You can apply at most 1 grace token on each assignment at your own discretion. This gives you some flexibility to cope with your own schedule.
  * According to the University’s regulation, every assignment must be accompanied by a signed declaration of originality; submissions without it will receive zero mark.
  * The declaration form is available [here](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/policy/academichonesty/Eng_htm_files_(2013-14)/declaration_en.doc).
- Lecture and tutorial:
  * Be on time. Set your mobile device to vibration/silient mode.
  * Feel free to ask questions and raise comments during the lecture, but we can only entertain short questions and discussions in-class.
  * Longer and deeper discussion and questions can happen in tutorials.
  * Follow University's regulations on COVID, including use of masks, hand sanitization, seating with social distance, etc.
